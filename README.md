## Features

- **Keyboard-Controlled Gameplay**  
  Smooth directional control using arrow keys. Responsive snake movement and classic gameplay logic.

- **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**  
  Easily switch between dark and light themes for visual comfort. Toggle is always accessible in the corner.

- **Custom Grid Size**  
  Choose from Small (10px), Medium (20px), or Large (25px) grid cell sizes to scale the snake and difficulty.

- **Adjustable Speed**  
  Select your desired game pace: Slow (150ms), Normal (100ms), or Fast (60ms). Speed affects game difficulty.

- **Sound Effects**  
  Enjoy satisfying eating sounds on food pickup. You can enable or disable sound at any time.

- **High Score Tracking**  
  Your highest score is saved locally in the browser using `localStorage`, so it persists even after closing the tab.

- **Pause and Resume**  
  Pause the game mid-run and resume exactly where you left off. Useful for taking breaks without losing progress.

- **Responsive UI**  
  Clean and minimal layout works on various screen sizes. Built with accessibility and mobile scaling in mind.
